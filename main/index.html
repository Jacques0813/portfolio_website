                <h2 class="hidden">About me</h2>
                <p class="hidden">Hi there! My name is Jacques and I have been doing programming for 5 years as of 2023 and plan to continue to do so.</p>
                <p class="hidden">&#9660;Be prepare for a cheesy inspirational speech below&#9660;</p>
                <p class="hidden">I believe that knowledge is the greatest asset that we as human beings have had the fortune of obtaining that made us skyrocket to the top of the foodchain. Now it is our responsibility to make good use of this power we have obtained by improving the environment (and the very universe) around us, not just for us homo sapiens (wise man) but for all living organisms.
                </p>
                <p class="hidden">That is the reason why I do programming. I want to aid in creating a world where technology aids us rather than replaces us. And not just to solve problems, but to reflect on them as well. To acknowledge when we are wrong and see where we went wrong in order improve on them in the future. To constantly improve from within, that is what I think it means to be a part of wise man.</p>

            <section id="contents">
                <h2 class="hidden">Contents</h2>
                <p class="hidden">The contents of this webpage are pretty simple. The following contents are things I did during my development as a programmer that I find interesting.</p>
                <p class="hidden">Some things to note:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li class="hidden">These are not ALL the things I did. Anybody with basic programming knowledge can do basic programming functions on multiple platforms.</li>
                    <li class="hidden">I'm still young, don't have a direction to specialize in yet, and my wisdom is purely driven by curiousity. All these things are intertwined and influence each other. The older you get, the more you thought about things, the more opportunities you got to find things that you find curious, and the more you solidify your direction through those things you find curious. At least that's what I think and we all hope for.</li>
                    <li class="hidden">And no, it is not only programming that contributes to wisdom (kind of funny if it was). There are many other things that enrich lives, it all depends on the person you ask. There are also many other skills that contribute to wisdom that cannot be explained but rather shown through actions like leadership, emotional intelligence, adaptability, and much more. So unfortunately these can't be shown here. You'll have to be the judge when you get to know me in person.</li>

            <section id="color_tracker">
                <h2 class="hidden">Colour tracking system</h2>
                <p class="hidden">The insparation behind this was pretty simple. A youtuber by the name of Micheal Reeves made his goldfish buy stocks for him by viewing stocks either on the right or left side of the tank and determining the stock to buy by what area his fish spent the most time within a 5 minute time frame. This was done by a color tracker so I tried it myself because I always wanted to know how hardware gets connected with code. This example tracks the largest concentration of red, and orange being the largest concentration here gets marked with a box.</p>

            <section id="monitoring">
                <h2 class="hidden">Monitoring system on a web server</h2>
                <p class="hidden">I was fortunate enough to partake in Belgium Campus's international project for the year 2023. We were working together with Lockheed Martin (famous for making an AI piloted fighter jet that managed to pilot without error for 17 hours) and Pennstate University from Pennsylvania and were tasked to create a hybrid powering system for a UAV (a drone) by sharing the power load between a battery and RC plane motor with the hopes of extending flight time. Our job was to aid the technical side (Pennsate) in monitoring various measurements throughout the system for testing purposes and that is what you see here. This example is imported locally, but the actual version runs on a web server with node-red installed.</p>
